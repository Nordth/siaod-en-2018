**1)** User enters set of numbers. When he has entered value 0. Program should print numbers in reverse order. Use **stack** for this task

Example:

Input:

```
1 2 3 4 5 6 0
```

Output:

```
6 5 4 3 2 1
```

-----

*2)* User enters set of numbers. When he has entered value 0, program should print firstly all entered odd values and then all even numbers in normal order. Use **queue** for this task

1 2 3 4 5 6 0
```

Output:

```
1 3 5 2 4 6
```

------

*3)* Users enters math expression. Program should writes all parts enclosed in parentheses. And print if all parentheses is closed. Use **stack** for this task

Example 1:

Input:

```
((x + 2) - y) + (z * 3)
```

Output:

```
(x + 2)
((x + 2) - y)
(z * 3)
Expression is correct
```



Example 2:

Input:

```
((a + 2) + (b - 2)
```

Output:

```
(a + 2)
(b - 2)
Expression is wrong
```
